  <h1>Welcome to the NetEscape homepage!</h1><br>
  
  <p>We are a discord server made for webmasters. A niche community for html/css enjoyers basically. Whether you have a finished website or not, you are welcome.<br>
  Speaking of, if you don't have a website made yet, you are in luck! You can make an account over at <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, as it is what most of us use to host our websites.<br>
  you can use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools</a> html tutorial to get started!.</p><br>
  
  <p>Our community welcomes fandom lovers, artists of all medias, gamers and game makers, those of all subcultures, and cringe people alike. If you'd like to meet more people like yourself, join our discord and explore the channels we have already! If you feel that there's something missing, you can suggest changes at any time *within reason.</p><br>
